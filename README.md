# Project NLP | Business Case: Automated Customer Reviews

The goal of this project is to develop a product review system. That can classify sentiment, cluster by product categories and write product summaries into recommendation articles.

For this project a dataset with **Amazon reviews** is used, more specifically reviews from the **Video Games** category. This data set can be found here üëâ https://amazon-reviews-2023.github.io/ üëà

## üìä Best Results

Best-performing model for review sentiment classification was **RoBERTa-base**:

- **Accuracy:** 0.875  
- **F1 Score (Macro Avg):** 0.734  
- **Precision (Macro Avg):** 0.719  
- **Recall (Macro Avg):** 0.766  
- **Weighted F1 Score:** 0.885  

## üîç Clusters found

 - **Keyboards & Mice**
 - **Headsets & Audio**
 - **Games**
 - **Controllers**

## ü§ó Models and deployment on HuggingFace

üëâ https://huggingface.co/spaces/DaanBooy/games_and_accessories_reviews üëà

**What you can do:**
- **Classification tab:** Upload a review and see its sentiment classification (RoBERTa-base).
- **Clustering view:** Explore product category clusters.
- **Summaries:** Read AI-generated articles highlighting top products, main complaints, and the worst product per category.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run & Reproduce Results

**Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

**Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Data Preparation**  
Run `data_prep.ipynb` to preprocess the Amazon Video Games review dataset.

**Train Models**
- `review_classification_dbu.ipynb` ‚Üí DistilBERT  
- `review_classification_bbu.ipynb` ‚Üí BERT-base  
- `review_classification_rb.ipynb` ‚Üí RoBERTa-base

**Evaluate Models**  
Use `model_comparison_viz.ipynb` to visualize results (precision, recall, F1, confusion matrix).

**Clustering**
- Run `review_clustering_sample.ipynb` for exploratory clustering.  
- Run `review_clustering_full.ipynb` to cluster the full dataset into 4 categories.

**Summarization**  
Execute `review_summarization.ipynb` to generate product recommendation articles.

**Deployment**  
Use `model_deployment_HF.ipynb` to deploy the system to Hugging Face Spaces.

**Notes:**  
To ensure you have enough RAM to run notebooks, use Google Colab on GPU T4 (High-RAM).  
To run `review_summarization.ipynb`, make sure you create a `.env` file in your project folder/Google Drive containing your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
